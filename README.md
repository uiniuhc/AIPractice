There are some small code pieces.
Folder 'ab','path_finding', and 'prover' are part of my assignment in an AI course.
Folder 'ab' has some code about alpha-beta game playing, to get better speed, I did some bad design in this work.
Folder 'path_finding' is about some search algorithms.
Folder 'prover' is a simplified fol prover.
